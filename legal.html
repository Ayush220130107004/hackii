            <h2>Legal and Ethical Guidelines in Criminal Profiling</h2>
            <p>Understanding the legal and ethical considerations is paramount in the field of criminal profiling. We adhere to the following guidelines:</p>

            <h3>1. Privacy and Data Protection</h3>
            <p>We prioritize the privacy and data protection rights of individuals. Any data collected is handled in compliance with relevant privacy laws.</p>

            <h3>2. Non-Discrimination</h3>
            <p>We do not engage in profiling that discriminates against individuals based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or other protected characteristics.</p>

            <h3>3. Informed Consent</h3>
            <p>Where applicable, we seek informed consent from individuals involved in profiling activities and clearly communicate the purpose and scope of data collection.</p>

            <h3>4. Collaboration with Authorities</h3>
            <p>We collaborate with law enforcement agencies and follow legal procedures to ensure profiling activities align with the law.</p>

            <h3>5. Transparency</h3>
            <p>We are committed to transparency in our methods and findings, facilitating public trust and accountability.</p>
